            The Devi Mahatmya is a text of Hindu philosophy describing the goddess Durga as the supreme power and
            
            creator of the universe. It is part of the Markandeya Purana. This illustration, created with 
            
            watercolour and ink on paper, is from an early-18th-century Nepalese folio of the Devi Mahamya, and 
            
            depicts the goddess Ambika leading the eight mother goddesses in battle against the asura (demon spirit)
            
            Raktabīja. A few Sanskrit words are written across the painting, which was gifted to the Los Angeles 
            
            County Museum of Art in California.
